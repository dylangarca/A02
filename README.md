How to use VS Code:
Step 1. Install VS Code
You can go to VS Code's official website to download it, make sure you download it for the proper OS. 
Step 2. Open VS Code
After the download is complete you can launch VS Code
Step 3. Open a Folder or File
So once VS Code fully opens you will have to Click File > Open Folder (to work with a project). This will open and the folder and display the code files that you have inside it.
Step 4. Install Extensions (Optional but Recommended)
Since it is the first time insalling VS Code you will most liekly need to install extensions to be able to code in the language you would like to. So to download an extension you have to click the Extensions icon  or (Ctrl + Shift + X). Then you search for the extension you are looking for, an example could be downloading the Java Extension Pack.
Step 5. Open the Terminal
To open the terminal you would click Terminal > New Terminal, this is going to allow you to run commands like compiling code, running scripts, or using Git
6. Create and Edit Files
Now to create a file you can click File > New File or Right-click in the Explorer Panel and select New File. Also make sure that the end of the file name ends in whatever language you are going to code in. For example if you are going to code in python you would end the file name with .py
Step 7. Run Code
To be able to run the code you can install the Code Runner extension or you can use the built-in terminal to run code. So for java if you are using the terminal you would have to compile the file by saying javac file.java then after it is compiled you have to write java file, then this should work and run your code.
Step 8. Use Git for Version Control (Optional)
So you can use Git as a version control where you can send all your files to as a back up. So to be able to use git you have to open a new terminal, the default terminal should be powershell so to use git you are going to have to make a new terminal and open a git bash terminal. Then after that you will have to initialize and link your computer with git using a specific lines to terminal code. But after that process you would initialize a repository and add/commit changes.
Step 9. Customize Settings
So you can customize your setting but it is necessary to do it. But if you want to you would Click File > Preferences > Settings then you can adjust themes, font size, and other preferences.
Step 10. Close VS Code
Lastly you would make sure that everything is saved you can ctrl +s to save or you can Click File > Save. Then after making sure everything is saved you can close the application by clicking the X in the top right corner.
